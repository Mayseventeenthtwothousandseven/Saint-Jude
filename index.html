Here at St. Jude Research hospital we want to help children in need. We will give them the best care and treatment. We do this cause we care. We beleive that we will show children the kindness and love of God through our action. Years ago our founder, Danny Thomas, was struggling for work with a child on its way. He prayed for a job and for God to help him, and he did. He was finding work and eventuaaly became a radio star. He was one of the biggest stars on radio, television in his age. He used his wealth to create a hospital for children, the one you know now, and named it after St. Jude the apostle who was known for being a patron saint of hopeless causes.

Ask Esther Obeng, M.D., Ph.D., about her job title, one that preceded her position at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, that’s a particular point of pride for her. “Both of my parents instilled in myself and my brothers the importance of obtaining a good education in order to achieve goals and accomplish something positive.” “And that’s one of the reasons that I ended up at St. Jude,” she said. “I was very interested and excited for the opportunity to take part in such a novel mission, to try to cure the incurable.” After arriving, she learned about the research hospital’s history as the first fully integrated children’s hospital in the South and about its continuing focus in the areas of diversity, equity and inclusion. Contributions from donors make it possible for doctors and scientists like Obeng to conduct research and help find cures while ensuring no family that is treated at St. Jude ever receives a bill. One of Obeng's favorite experiences came when she emerged from her lab one day and saw a patient who previously had experienced complications waving to her as she left the hospital to go home. "I think that connection — being able to be in the lab five minutes ago and then five minutes later see your patient, see that they made it home, I think is one of the special St. Jude moments," Obeng said. In her lab, Obeng delves into some of the most vexing mysteries of leukemia, such as why normal cells turn cancerous and how cancer cells can become resistant to drugs. “What we’ve been focused on is trying to identify how different genetic changes or mutations cause normal cells to grow like cancer cells, with the goal of trying to find specific agents or therapies that will wipe out those cancer cells without causing much more toxicity,” she said. Obeng’s lab is working with a number of different patient groups. "One of the reasons that I study the research that I do is I had a patient who had a type of bone marrow failure syndrome. And her parents said, when she ultimately passed away, that they knew that they received the best care possible, and they just wished we knew something more," Obeng said. "That inspires me, in my research, to look for something more. It’s a privilege every day to take care of patients just like that one.”

Support Saint Jude. They do so much for families that have diseases. They need to be rewarded for their hard work.
