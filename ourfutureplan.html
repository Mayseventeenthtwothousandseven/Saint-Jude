<p> At St. Jude our number one problem is cancer. We have been and will continue to focus our resources toward finding a cure for cancer. We will not be satisfied until we have no more children coming into our hospital. We do not like to see kids coming here with diseases that are extremely difficult for even adults to bear. We want to never have a kid go through that. Starting with cancer. We would also like to have more hospitals around the world. If we were to accomplish this we would be able to reach much more children. It would also help us reach people outside of America. We could reach children that struggle with so many more things than just cancer. We could grow to Africa, China, South Korea, and much more. Of course, if we were to reach this goal we will need people to donate. It is the best way to help us and more importantly the kids.
